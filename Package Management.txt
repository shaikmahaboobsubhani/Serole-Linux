Package Management:

Package is nothing but s/w in linux , depends upon the user's requirement we can install/uninstall the package/software in linux that is called as package management

in linux we have two types of linux distributions so we can install two types for linux families


1: RedHat
2: Debian



RedHat Package Management(rpm)

if we need to install a s/w , we  need to download the s/w then we can install.

you need to download and install .rpm packagesI(.rpm redhat package management)

if we have .rpm file /package we can install by using

$rpm -ivh(install verbrose file) filename
$ rpm -ivh java89y3i4.rpm



Debian Package Managemenet(.deb)

if we need to install a s/w , we  need to download the s/w then we can install.

you need to download and install .deb packagesI(.deb Debian package management)

if we have .deb file /package we can install by using

$ deb -ivh filename

$ deb -ivh java8jdfdnfdd.deb



i  these two processes we are not installing dependencies directly

YUM for RedHat (yellow dog update management)
Apt for debian (Advance Packing Tool)
