Types of users in linux:

4 types of users linux:

1: super user  -- if make sudo -i it will goes to root user , root user userid is 0(ZERO)

2: system users -- Linux treats installed s/w as system users and it will starts from 1 to end with 499 in b/w these users name it as system users

3: normal users : normal users also be users who are created by the superuser(root) , normal user id starts from 500 end with 63000+ 
 
4: sudo users : stands for superuser root /super do 

we can add normal user into sudoers file/visudo then he will be become as as sudouser then he will get additional permissions  than normal user


Swithing the  user:

$ su - username

$ su - jaani
 ex: [root@Linux ~]# su - jaani
     [jaani@Linux ~]$



visudo , we can make  normaluser (mahaboob) into sudo user, so that we can add user in below location of visudo file


## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands

%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
%mahaboob ALL=(ALL)       ALL
## Same thing without a password



Note: if you can user sudoers users infront the command give sudo every time

$ sudo mkdir dirname
$ sudo ls
$ sudo useradd username
$ sudo cat /etc/passwd ......etc
