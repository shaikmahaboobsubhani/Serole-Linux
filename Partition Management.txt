$ fdisk -l : to list out the available disks in linux

if you want to crate a another disk / mew disk from the existing vol we can select that volume first by using below command

$ fdisk /dev/xdf/xfadf/xdmdm/btd .....etc

and then  if you don't know how to create the volume simply press 'm' for help it will gives you the instructions

Help:

  DOS (MBR)
   a   toggle a bootable flag
   b   edit nested BSD disklabel
   c   toggle the dos compatibility flag

  Generic
   d   delete a partition
   F   list free unpartitioned space
   l   list known partition types
   n   add a new partition
   p   print the partition table
   t   change a partition type
   v   verify the partition table
   i   print information about a partition

  Misc
   m   print this menu
   u   change display/entry units
   x   extra functionality (experts only)

  Script
   I   load disk layout from sfdisk script file
   O   dump disk layout to sfdisk script file

  Save & Exit
   w   write table to disk and exit
   q   quit without saving changes

  Create a new label
   g   create a new empty GPT partition table
   G   create a new empty SGI (IRIX) partition table
   o   create a new empty DOS partition table
   s   create a new empty Sun partition table



here if you wantted to create a new disk you can simply press 'n'
 then it will ask us to provide partion type

Partition type

   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)



and the you can save and exit the disk partion for simply press 'w'

and then you can format the disk and mounted to any other directory for storing your data

$ mkfs.ext4 diskname

$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1 

and then mount the formatted disk to the dir

$ mount diskname dirname

$ mount /dev/xvdf1 jaani/

if you wanted to check the free diskspaces in linux

$ df -h

if you wanted to check the disk usage in linux

$ du -h

if you wanted to check the specific disk usage in linux

$ du -h diskname/dir name


$ du -h jaani/



LVM(Logical Volume Management)

1:pv create : Phical volume 
2:vg create : volume groupname for phisical volume
3: lv create  : large volume with the help of vg name

	$pvcreate diskname
	
ex: 
	$ pvcreate /dev/xvdg
output: Physical volume created

To display phisical vol path and info

$pvdisplay

next i wamted to craete vg name

$ vgcreate volgrouoname diskname

$ vgcreate subbu /dev/xvdg

To display vg name and info

$ vgdisplay 

LVM create :

$ lvcraete -L+5G -n lvcraetename vgcreatename

ex: lvcreate -L + 5G -n sms subbu

Logical volume created

i wanted to format and mounted to dir

$ mkfs.ext4 lvpath(/dev/subbu/sms)

 ex:  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Path                /dev/subbu/sms
  LV Name                sms
  VG Name                subbu
  LV UUID                PmPo0m-1c2A-FwcR-VKqC-UQfU-UGme-0j2NiS
  LV Write Access        read/write
  LV Creation host, time Linux, 2020-10-21 02:51:16 +0000
  LV Status              available
  # open                 0
  LV Size                5.00 GiB
  Current LE             1280
  Segments               1
  Allocation             inherit
  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           253:0

mount the logical vol to dir:

mount /dev/subbu/sms sns
