How To Create The Files

3 ways

1.cat : this is used to create the files and modifiled the files and view the files
2.touch : by using touch command we can create only temporary files and we cam create number of files at a time and empty files
3. vi (virtual Editor)  : this is used to create the files and modifiled the files and view the files

Let's get started for practice:

Cat:
to craete the file
 $cat > filename 

 ex: cat > sms (file name)
To view the file 
 $ cat filename
  
 ex: cat sms(filename)

To appaned the file / modify the file 
 
  $ cat >> oldfilename

  ex: cat >> sms (>> is to used for append mode)
To create the file by using touch command :
 
  $ touch filename
  
  ex: touch sms(filename)
   
 Note: by default tocuh command will create the empty files only
To crate multiple files by using touch command

 $ touch filename1 filename2 filename3 ....... filename n
  
  ex: $ touch basha subhani jilani (file names)

To crate a file by using vi(virtual editor) 

 $ vi filename

ex: vi mahi(filename) by default it is in commad mode for editing the file we can switch into inssert mode by using i (" i " )
 
   i :  insert mode

To save and quit the file by using 

$  Esc + shift : + wq 
   
   Note:  wq(save and quit)

we have 3 Modes in files :
  1. command mode
  2. insert mode
  3. execution mode
To copy the content from one file to another file by using cp (copy command)

$ cp oldfilename newfilename 
 ex: cp sms mahi
To move/ rename the file by using mv (move command)

$ mv oldfilename newfilename 


diff b/w cp and mv is " to copy the file old file also present in the system" but by using mv command " to rename the file" means old file was removed and content was be present in newfile name

 
Command mode:

Once you open the file by using vi/vim editor , editor will bw opended be default it will be in an command mode , so we cann't modify/edit the file/insert the files (simply view of some content in file).

Insertmode:

in this mode you can edot the file and modify the file 
bu using  click on "i" command mode will be switched into insert mode , so that we can edit the file / modify the files


Extend mode:

in this mode you can save and exit froma file / we can exit without saving a file
